Search and organize football matches

## Description

Timbo is a social app where users can organize football matches with friends or search for free spots in other matches around a specific area.

## Backend

Timbo backend is built using [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and it uses [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) as its database. 

## How it works

- The application has a screen where the user can login using a Facebook Account or register with mail and password.
- Once logged in, Timbo shows a list of available matches which the user can request to play. They can be either matches being organized by its friends or matches being played near the user.
- The user has the option to create its own match indicating the place where it is going to be played, date and time. Once the match is created, the user can send invitations to its friends.
- Timbo gives the user the option to choose the match privacy between the following options
	- public: any user on Timbo can request to play
	- private: only friends can request to play
	- secret: only users with invitation can play
